/*css changesets to information page...for the block of "hao you tong ji" 
 * shall we use frofile-small list instead of the name-link list?
 *And I recommend to replace the ugly table with ul-list for info. display... 
 * tr border...feel sick of it...
 * It's more convenient for ul-list to define the style...

If you have changed the table to ul, please tell me to add the style...
